## What Is Watchedlist?
Watchlist is a simple terminal program for tracking movies/series you watch. It is designed to be simple (For somebody who knows their way around the terminal) Yet Useful

## How Do I Use Watchedlist?
You can use Watchedlist by either, using the pre-built binaries in this repo ([TotalVirus](totalvirus.com) Scan for the latest binary), or building the binary yourself (Recommended), I put more information about this in the [Build.md](build.md) file. But you should be able to run `make all`, and ding fries are done.

## Commandline arguments
As i said watchedlist is a terminal application, which means it work's by using arguments (I do not plan to make a gui).

| Argument | Functionality |
| -------- | ------------- |
| --add/-a | Add a movie/series to the tracker |
| --del/-d | Remove a movie/series from the tracker |
